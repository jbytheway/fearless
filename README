travel and observation.

For building instructions see INSTALL.

Fearless contains the following components:

- fearless
  A support library which provides the implementation of various pertinent
  physical things as well as the maths behind them.

- bin/explore
  A simple interactive interface allowing you to fly around (by default) the
  nearby stellar neighbourhood at implausible accelerations and speeds.

- data
  Assorted data used by the programs.

- test_data
  A simpler version of data to be used with debug versions without crippling
  their performance as the full data does.

- doc
  Developer documentation and tools.
