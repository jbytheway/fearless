This project uses makeshift to build.  If the makeshift directory is empty then
you probably need to run

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Next you will need some dependencies:

- gcc >= 4.4 (this code uses recently added C++0x features so new gcc really is
  needed; other compilers are unikely to cope in the near term)
- boost >= 1.42 (maybe 1.41 will work; if you get spirit errors then you need a
  newer version).  If your distro splits boost into multiple packages you'll
  need the general one and Boost.Filesystem.
- freeglut.  The old non-free GLUT won't do.
- optimal, my options parsing library.  Read about it at
  http://github.com/jbytheway/optimal or clone it from
  git@github.com:jbytheway/optimal.git

You may need to add some things to user.mk, e.g. to get the right g++ version
or allow it to find optimal if you don't install it (which you shouldn't need
to.  Here for example is my user.mk:

  CXX = g++-4.4.1
  BUILD_CPPFLAGS += -I$(top_srcdir)../optimal
  BUILD_LDFLAGS += -L$(top_srcdir)../optimal/optimal

See makeshift/INSTALL for details of what goes in user.mk.

Then to get a debug version it should be simply

$ make

and you can run a few tests with

$ make test

The debug version will have an abominable framerate with the default data; try
using the test_data which is much smaller.  e.g.

$ ./bin/explore/explore -d test_data/

If it all works you can build the release version with

$ make release

This will build inside a directory called release.  This should run OK on the
full data:

$ ./release/bin/explore/explore
